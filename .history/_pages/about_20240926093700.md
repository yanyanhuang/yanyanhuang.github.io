<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm currently a second year PhD student at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Lequan Yu](https://yulequan.github.io/). I obtained my MPhil degree in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2023 and the B.Eng degree in [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. I am dedicated to designing advanced machine learning algorithms for medical image analysis and network neuroscience. Currently, I mainly focus on deep learning algorithms for whole slide image analysis.

I am also a machine learning competition enthusiast and a [Kaggle Competitions Master](https://www.kaggle.com/rock139) (🥇×2, 🥈×2).

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
